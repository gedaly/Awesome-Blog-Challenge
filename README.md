# Awesome Blog Challenge

## What is it?
A challenge to publish & promote 30 pieces of content in 30 days, on a blog you own.
Can be written articles, audio/podcast, or video.

## Why do one? What will it do for me?
Very quickly establishes your authority and credibility in a topic. Great way to get started with a new business or to ramp up your marketing for an existing business.

Promoting your work daily will solidify that you are the “go to person” for whatever you’re writing about.
Your referrals from your network will increase
You will have a better handle on your subject matter
You may get found more often in search engines
You can stop answering the same questions over and over and just send a link

## How to get started…
Get a blog
WP.com, self hosted, or blogger
Own domain recommended, not required.

## The Rules
Publish one piece of content every day for 30 days on your blog
Post a link on all your social media sites
Share a link (PM, email) privately to at least 2 people who you think would get value from it

## Best Practices

Choose 1 media type for the whole challenge: Written / Audio / Video

I recommend written posts because it requires the least amount of equipment and is easiest to get started. 
If you don’t have experience with audio or video recording and publishing, don’t experiment with it now. The point is to make it really easy to get started. Make it easy to do it every day. Once you get in the habit of publishing regularly, then experiment with new tech.
