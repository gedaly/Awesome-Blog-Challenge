Welcome to the 🦄magical homepage for the Awesome Blog Challenge! (aka: ABC)

## ❓What is it?
Awesome Blog Challenge is:
**A challenge to publish & promote 30 pieces of content in 30 days, on a blog you own.**

Let's break it down...

### A Challenge
It's called a challenge because it's not easy. It requires discipline, effort, endurance, and courage. If you choose to accept this challenge, you will find struggles along the way. You will also find it extremely rewarding.

### Publish
Not just a draft, or an idea... actually click the publish button and send it to the internet.
This can be scary, but that's why we call it a challenge.

### Promote
Ok it's live... but the next step is to make sure that people actually know about it!
This is a two part process:
* Make a public post on your social networks (Facebook & Twitter)
* Send a private message (Email, FB messenger, Twitter DM, etc) to at least 2 people who would benefit from/enjoy your post

### 30 Pieces of Content
Choose written, audio, or video.
I recommend written since it's easiest.
Keep it simple!

### 30 Days
Publish & Promote one every. single. day.
You can create 10 pieces of content in a day if you want, but publishing and promoting every day is important.

### On A Blog You Own
This is not submitting 30 articles to an online magazine. This is about publishing on a blog you control so that you can guarantee it gets published... to build your authority and your audience.

## 🐒Why do one? What will it do for me?
Very quickly establishes your authority and credibility in a topic. Great way to get started with a new business or to ramp up your marketing for an existing business.

Promoting your work daily will solidify that you are the “go to person” for whatever you’re writing about.
Your referrals from your network will increase
You will have a better handle on your subject matter
You may get found more often in search engines
You can stop answering the same questions over and over and just send a link

## 🏁How to get started…
Get a blog
WP.com, self hosted, or blogger
Own domain recommended, not required.

## 📖The Rules
Publish one piece of content every day for 30 days on your blog
Post a link on all your social media sites
Share a link (PM, email) privately to at least 2 people who you think would get value from it

## 😻Best Practices

Choose 1 media type for the whole challenge: Written / Audio / Video

I recommend written posts because it requires the least amount of equipment and is easiest to get started. 
If you don’t have experience with audio or video recording and publishing, don’t experiment with it now. The point is to make it really easy to get started. Make it easy to do it every day. Once you get in the habit of publishing regularly, then experiment with new tech.

## 👫Support
Facebook Support Group for sharing questions, progress, etc.

## 💻The Story Behind ABC
Hi, I'm [Gedaly](https://gedaly.com) and I initally created the Awesome Blog Challenge as a way to build the blog for my web design services. I was blogging regularly but I wanted to ramp things up. So I decided I'd do publish 30 posts in 30 days and promote as much as I could.

### What Happened?
Since I was publishing every day and sharing on my social networks, my friends and followers got a real good idea of what I know. There it was in their feed, a reminder that I know something about web marketing.

So I was top of mind... so my referrals increased.
I got more traffic to my site.
Lots more content meant more search traffic.
I had plenty of content to share on my email newsletter.
And I learned a ton.
