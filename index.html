          <h2>ü§∑‚Äç What is it?</h2>
          <p><strong>An epic quest to publish & promote 30 pieces of content in 30 days, on a blog you own.</strong></p>

          <p>Let's break it down...</p>

          <h3>An Epic Quest</h3>
          <p>It's called a challenge because, well... it's hard. It's supposed to be. This challenge requires discipline, effort, endurance, and courage. If you choose to accept this quest, you will find struggles along the way. You will also find it extremely rewarding!</p>

          <h3>Publish</h3>
          <p>Not just a draft, or an idea... actually click the publish button and send it to the internet.
          This can be scary, but that's why we call it a challenge.</p>

          <h3>Promote</h3>
          <p>Ok it's live... now make sure that people actually know about it!</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Make a public post on your social networks </li>
              <li>Send a private message to at least 2 people who would benefit from/enjoy your post</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>30 Pieces of Content</h3>
          <p>Choose written, audio, or video.
          I recommend written since it's easiest.
          Keep it simple!</p>

          <h3>30 Days</h3>
          <p>Publish & Promote one every. single. day.</p>

          <h3>On A Blog You Own</h3>
          <p>This is not submitting 30 articles to an online magazine. It's not writing 30 long posts on Facebook. This is about publishing on a website you control so that you can guarantee it gets published, build your authority, attract an audience, and own your content.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="why">

          <h2>üêí Why Participate?</h2>

          <p>Publishing your own content has many benefits. Publishing a lot can really increase that!</p>

          <h3>Benefits of Blogging</h3>
              <ul>
                  <li></li>
                  <li></li>
              </ul>

          <h3>Bonus Benefits of the Challenge</h3>
              <ul>
                  <li>Very quickly establishes your authority and credibility for a topic in the mind of your immediate network</li>
                  <li>Promoting your work daily will solidify that you are the ‚Äúgo to person‚Äù for whatever you‚Äôre writing about.</li>
                  <li></li>
                  <li></li>

          Your referrals from your network will increase
          You will have a better handle on your subject matter

      <section id="start">

          <h2>üèÅ Get started</h2>

          ## How to get started‚Ä¶
          Get a blog
          WP.com, self hosted, or blogger
          Own domain recommended, not required.

          ## üìñThe Rules
          Publish one piece of content every day for 30 days on your blog
          Post a link on all your social media sites
          Share a link (PM, email) privately to at least 2 people who you think would get value from it

          ## üòª Best Practices

          Choose 1 media type for the whole challenge: Written / Audio / Video

          I recommend written posts because it requires the least amount of equipment and is easiest to get started.
          If you don‚Äôt have experience with audio or video recording and publishing, don‚Äôt experiment with it now. The point is to make it really easy to get started. Make it easy to do it every day. Once you get in the habit of publishing regularly, then experiment with new tech.

          <h2>üó£ Stories from Challengers</h2>

          ## üíªThe Story Behind ABC
          Hi, I'm [Gedaly](https://gedaly.com) and I initally created the Awesome Blog Challenge as a way to build the blog for my web design services. I was blogging regularly but I wanted to ramp things up. So I decided I'd do publish 30 posts in 30 days and promote as much as I could.

          ### What Happened?
          Since I was publishing every day and sharing on my social networks, my friends and followers got a real good idea of what I know. There it was in their feed, a reminder that I know something about web marketing.

          So I was top of mind... so my referrals increased.
          I got more traffic to my site.
          Lots more content meant more search traffic.
          I had plenty of content to share on my email newsletter.
          And I learned a ton.

          <blockquote>When I was struggling to be consistent blogging, Gedaly invited me into a 30-day blog challenge during which I was to publish one blog a day for 30 days. Knowing I needed some sort of kickstart, I accepted! Not only did I prove to myself that getting good content published every day was completely possible, it was also the juiciness my website needed that led me to getting more invitations to be interviewed on Podcasts, contribute guest posts, and to being interviewed for other media outlets! I will always remember that 30 days, and I‚Äôve used the structure of the challenge he gave me to accomplish other goals as well!

          <h2>üì¢ Frequently Asked Questions</h2>


          <h3>When Does It Start?</h3>
          <p>The challenge is always happening with other challengers around the world. It's an individual journey, so you can start whenever you're ready. </p>
          <p>Choose when you want to begin, mark, your calendar, and go for it.</p>
          <p>If this sounds like it's for you... prepare today and start tomorrow!</p>

          <h3>Do Have To?</h3>
          <p>Only if you want the benefits.</p>

          <h3>Where do I share my posts once they've been published?</h3>
          <p>Share your newly published post of the day to any social network you're active on: ie. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. Ideally all of them!</p>
          <p>Then send your private message thru anywhere the other people are likely to get it: ie. email, FB messenger, Twitter DM, Instagram DM, etc.</p>

          <h3>Can I Do 30 Instagram Posts or 30 YouTube Videos Instead?</h3>
          <p>Ultimately it's up to you. The important part is to publish every day and share your work.</p>
          <p>If you're really focused on building your YouTube channel, this makes sense. Just consider your goals. Most of the time building your own platform will take you further in the long run.</p>

          <h3>Can I Make My Content Ahead of Time?</h3>
          <p>You can create 10 pieces of content in a day if you really want, just publish and promote one every single day.</p>
          <p>It's highly beneficial to spend a day or two per week where you batch your content and work on drafts of your content. Why? Staring at a blank page at 11:59pm on a day when you need to publish is not a fun place to be. Life happens. Being a day or two ahead can really relieve som stress.</p>
          <p>However, don't plan on doing ALL of your content ahead of time. Why? Well, for starters, that's a lot of content. And if you're a perfectionist and over-achiever and you think you'd want to do that... but know that you'll never have time to create all that content ahead of time, you've now talked yourself out of doing the challenge. Don't give yourself a reason not to participate! Also, there's some magic that happens once you're partway through the process. You'll get new ideas, people will ask you for something on a particular topic. Find your own balance of how much to do ahead of time.</p>
